> This is a project to refresh unit testing skill and learn enzyme for shallow rendering and perhaps other fancy things.

## Install

``` bash
$ npm install --save-dev enzyme jest-cli@20.0.4
```
**NOTE**: `jest-cli@20.0.4` is used because the newer version has a conflict with current version Enzyme (true as of March 2018)
